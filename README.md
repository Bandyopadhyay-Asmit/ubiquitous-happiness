OBSTACLE_AVOIDING_ROBOT_CODE FOR ARDUINO
In this project, I build an obstacle avoiding robot using Arduino IDE which can detect obstacles in its path and maneuver around them without marking any collision. It is a robot vehicle that works on Arduino Microcontroller and employs ultrasonic distance censor to detect obstacles.
